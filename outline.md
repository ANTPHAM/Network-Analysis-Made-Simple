## Introduction

## NetworkX API Basics

- Assume intermediate-level competency with Python
- Learn how to query a graph in NetworkX:
    - Number of nodes
    - Querying node metadata
    - Number of edges
    - Querying edge metadata

## Topic 1: "How important are certain nodes?"

- Metric 1: The number of links going into and out of a node.
    - Number of neighbours
    - Degree centrality.
- Metric 2: The number of times that node shows up on shortest paths between any two nodes.
    - Shortest path algorithm: Breadth-first search.
- Not all metrics correlate with one another.

## Topic 2: "How do we find interesting structures?"

- Definition of a triangle: the simplest complex clique
- Finding triangles
- Finding open triangles

## Topic 3: Reading/writing Network data

-
