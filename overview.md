# Network Analysis Fundamentals

## Course description

Network analysis, and by extension network thinking, are the latest frontier in data science. Knowing how to think through data in a linked/networked fashion is a rare but valuable skill. This course will provide you with an introduction to graph theory while highlighting its applications in a variety of data problems. You will also become familiar with the Python NetworkX API, which will give you a solid foundation for using existing and implementing new algorithms.

## Learning objectives

* Learn how to represent graphs as a NetworkX graph object.
* Visualize network data in a structured and rational fashion (beyond 'hairball' visualizations).
* Write common algorithms (path finding, graph structure identification) that operate on graph-structured data.
* Read/write network data as node and edge lists, and their variants.
* Design basic inference tests on graph data.
* Model data using bipartite graphs and their unipartite projections.

## Prerequisites

* Introduction to Python
* Intermediate Python
* Computational Statistics?
